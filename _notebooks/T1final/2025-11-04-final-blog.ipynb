    "# **CSP Final Blog / Semester Reflection**\n",
    "\n",
    "This semester in CSP has been one of the biggest transformations in my academic journey. At the start of the year, my understanding of computer science was extremely limited. I didn’t know how to use a terminal, I had no idea how repositories were structured, and GitHub seemed like an advanced tool that only experienced programmers could navigate. Over the months, I learned not only how to control the terminal confidently, but also how to understand the logic behind commands and how they interact with files and code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Through practice and repetition, I became comfortable with working inside repositories, switching between directories, managing files, and collaborating through GitHub. I also became much more independent when solving errors. At the beginning of the year, any error message felt overwhelming — but now, I can slow down, think through what the error means, and fix it on my own or with minimal help. This shift has made me much more confident in my coding abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "A huge part of my growth came from collaboration. I made new friends in CSP, and working with people helped me understand concepts that would have been harder alone. Debugging together taught me real teamwork and strengthened my communication skills. Whenever we faced a confusing bug, instead of panicking, we learned to break the problem down and approach it logically. By the end of the semester, I felt a much deeper understanding of what it means to “think like a programmer.”\n",

    "## **Growth Across the Sprints**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tools Unit**\n",
    "During the Tools unit, I learned how to navigate efficiently through different project directories using the terminal. Commands like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `rm`, `git clone`, `git status`, `git add`, and `git push` went from being confusing words to tools I used every day. I learned not only *what* the commands do, but *why* they are essential. This unit taught me how developers manage their workflow professionally and gave me the confidence to work in a real development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Fundamentals of Python & JavaScript**\n",
    "In the Fundamentals sprint, I developed a strong base in both Python and JavaScript. I became comfortable using loops, variables, lists/arrays, conditional statements, and writing functions that return values. I also gained experience interpreting pseudocode, reading error messages, and translating logic from one language into another. Understanding control flow and data handling helped me prepare for more complex programming problems, and I realized how important it is to understand the “why” behind each line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **West Coast Travel / Digital Famine Project**\n",
    "This project deepened my understanding of GitHub submodules — a concept that at first felt extremely difficult. I learned how submodules allow you to connect multiple repositories inside one main repository, and how that structure is used in real-world projects. On the web design side, I experimented with layout designs, CSS styling, color palettes, typography, and content organization. I gained a better sense of what makes a webpage visually appealing and easy for users to understand. This sprint taught me creativity, problem-solving, and communication through design.\n",

    "## **Night at the Museum Reflection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Night at the Museum was a highlight of the semester. When people visited our table, they commented on how clean and organized our page looked. Parents appreciated how easy it was to read and navigate, and guests complimented the structure and visuals of our website. It was rewarding to watch people interact with something we created from scratch. Presenting the project helped me practice explaining technical work in a simple and confident way. I realized that communication and presentation are major parts of computer science — not just writing the code but showing the purpose behind it.\n",

    "## **What I Want to Learn Next**\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking ahead, I want to expand my knowledge of terminal shortcuts and commands to work more efficiently. I also want to improve my problem-solving strategies for College Board–style questions. Many of the AP CSP questions require strong logical thinking, pattern recognition, algorithm analysis, and understanding how code executes step-by-step. My goal is to practice these skills more so I can feel fully confident going into the AP exam. I also want to explore more advanced programming topics such as APIs, databases, asynchronous code, and deeper JavaScript or Python concepts.\n",

    "|-----------|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Q1 — Swapping Values** | D | B | I mixed up the correct order of assignments. A swap requires three exact steps (save → overwrite → restore). My answer overwrote the wrong value, breaking the logic. | Swapping ALWAYS follows: **temp ← first → first ← second → second ← temp** | • Understand assignment order  \n",
    "• Track variable changes  \n",
    "• Follow algorithm steps carefully |\n",
    "| **Q12 — Social Media Projection** | C | B | I didn’t analyze the growth pattern correctly. The increase is steady (~0.6 per year). I guessed instead of calculating trend. | Use **average rate of change** to make predictions. | • Read data tables  \n",
    "• Identify linear trends  \n",
    "• Predict values using patterns |\n",
    "| **Q15 — Internet Communication** | A | C | I incorrectly thought matching OS matters. Communication depends on protocols, NOT operating systems. | All devices need **IP addresses** and follow protocols. | • Know the purpose of protocols  \n",
    "• Understand IP addressing  \n",
    "• Distinguish OS vs. network rules |\n",
    "| **Q16 — Downloading Licensed Music** | A | B | I chose an option that is extremely likely (targeted ads). The question asked for the *least* likely outcome. | Ads = common, location-based reviews = rare. | • Analyze privacy consequences  \n",
    "• Identify likely vs. unlikely data usage  \n",
    "• Understand personalization algorithms |\n",
    "| **Q26 — Robot Movement** | C | A | I misread the robot logic. The correct program checks forward movement FIRST and rotates ONLY when blocked. | Robot logic: **check → move → rotate**. | • Trace robot movement  \n",
    "• Understand while/if logic  \n",
    "• Follow movement conditions precisely |\n",
    "| **Q31 — Loop Algorithms** | A | D | I didn’t simulate the robot’s moves completely. Neither program reaches the goal. | Always simulate step-by-step. | • Trace loops carefully  \n",
    "• Follow algorithm flow  \n",
    "• Visualize movement on grids |\n",
    "| **Q43 — Algorithm Runtime** | D | A | I confused approximation with runtime. The runtime grows quadratically (n²), which is still reasonable. | Polynomial = reasonable, exponential = unreasonable. | • Recognize runtime patterns  \n",
    "• Compare growth rates  \n",
    "• Understand algorithm efficiency |\n",
    "| **Q45 — NAND Logic Gate** | B | C | I forgot the correct Boolean meaning of NAND. NAND is the negation of AND. | NAND = **NOT (P AND Q)**. | • Know logic gate outputs  \n",
    "• Evaluate truth tables  \n",
    "• Apply Boolean expressions |\n",
    "| **Q46 — Undecidable Problems** | A | D | I incorrectly believed a low-level language could solve it. Undecidable means **no algorithm exists** for any language. | Undecidable = fundamentally unsolvable by algorithms. | • Understand decidability  \n",
    "• Recognize halting problem logic  \n",
    "• Know limits of computation |\n",
    "| **Q53 — Machine Learning Purpose** | D | A | I thought ML solves theoretical problems. It's actually about patterns, classification, and predictions using data. | ML = **patterns + predictions + data analysis**. | • Know ML applications  \n",
    "• Understand training data  \n",
    "• Identify patterns in datasets |\n",
    "| **Q59 — Movie Studio Media Librarian** | A | B | I didn’t consider the purpose of archiving. Lossy compression ruins quality permanently, making it the worst option. | Archiving must use **lossless only**. | • Know file compression types  \n",
    "• Understand data preservation  \n",
    "• Compare lossy vs. lossless formats |\n",

    "\n",
    "Looking back on the semester, I’m proud of how much progress I’ve made. I grew from someone who barely understood how to open a terminal to someone who can build projects, navigate GitHub, collaborate on code, and explain technical ideas with confidence. The skills I’ve learned — both technical and collaborative — will continue to support me as I move forward in computer science. This class gave me a strong foundation, and I’m excited to keep building on everything I’ve learned.\n",
