    "# ✨ **CSP Final Blog / Semester Reflection** ✨\n",
    "\n",
    "This semester in CSP has been one of the biggest transformations in my academic journey. At the start of the year, my understanding of computer science was extremely limited. I didn’t know how to use a terminal, I had no idea how repositories were structured, and GitHub felt like a tool only advanced programmers could navigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the months, I learned not only how to control the terminal confidently, but also how to understand the logic behind commands and how they interact with files and code. Through consistent practice, I became comfortable navigating directories, managing files, working with repositories, and collaborating using GitHub. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first, error messages felt overwhelming — but now, I can slow down, read them carefully, and fix problems much more independently. That shift has made me more confident in my coding abilities and helped me develop real problem-solving skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest sources of growth was collaboration 👥. I made new friends in CSP, and working together helped me understand concepts that would have been harder alone. Debugging as a group taught me patience, communication, and teamwork. By the end of the semester, I felt a much deeper understanding of what it really means to “think like a programmer.”\n",

    "## 🚀 **Growth Across the Sprints**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ **Tools Unit**\n",
    "During this sprint, I learned how to move efficiently through project directories using the terminal. Commands like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `rm`, `git clone`, `git status`, `git add`, and `git push` went from being confusing symbols to tools I actively relied on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I also understood *why* these commands matter — not just how to type them. This unit gave me confidence in using real developer workflows and taught me how professionals manage and organize code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Fundamentals of Python & JavaScript**\n",
    "This sprint gave me a solid foundation in two programming languages. I practiced loops, lists/arrays, conditionals, functions, return statements, and more. I also improved at reading pseudocode and translating ideas logically into working programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sprint helped me understand *control flow*, *logic*, and *how programs actually think*, which prepared me for more advanced concepts later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌐 **West Coast Travel / Digital Famine Project**\n",
    "This project challenged me in both technical and creative ways. I learned how GitHub submodules work (which felt confusing at first), and I improved my web-design abilities using HTML and CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "I experimented with layouts, colors, spacing, fonts, and content organization to make the project easier to read and understand. This sprint helped me balance creativity and technical skill — something important in real CS work.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🖼️ **Night at the Museum Reflection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Night at the Museum was one of the highlights of the semester. Visitors complimented the clean and organized design of our webpage, and parents said it was easy to navigate. It felt rewarding to present something we built from scratch and watch people genuinely enjoy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaining our project also helped me build confidence in talking about technical work out loud. CSP taught me not only how to code — but also how to communicate what I built and why it matters. 💬\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **What I Want to Learn Next**\n",
    "\n",
    "Next semester, I want to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn more advanced terminal shortcuts and commands ⚙️  \n",
    "- Improve my logic skills for AP-style MCQs 📘  \n",
    "- Strengthen my algorithm-tracing and pattern-recognition abilities  \n",
    "- Explore deeper programming topics like APIs, databases, asynchronous code, and advanced Python/JavaScript  \n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is to be fully prepared for the AP exam and continue building confidence as a developer.\n",

    "| Question # | My Answer | Correct Answer | What I Missed / Detailed Analysis | What to Remember | **Skill Points You Need to Know** |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Q1 — Swapping Values** | D | B | I mixed up the correct order of assignments. A swap requires three exact steps (save → overwrite → restore). My answer overwrote the wrong value, breaking the logic. | Swapping ALWAYS follows: **temp ← first → first ← second → second ← temp** | • Understand assignment order  \n",
    "• Track variable changes  \n",
    "• Follow algorithm steps carefully |\n",
    "| **Q12 — Social Media Projection** | C | B | I didn’t analyze the growth pattern correctly. The increase is steady (~0.6 per year). I guessed instead of calculating the trend. | Use **average rate of change** to make predictions. | • Read data tables  \n",
    "• Identify linear trends  \n",
    "• Predict values using patterns |\n",
    "| **Q15 — Internet Communication** | A | C | I incorrectly thought matching OS matters. Communication depends on protocols, NOT operating systems. | All devices need **IP addresses** and follow protocols. | • Know the purpose of protocols  \n",
    "• Understand IP addressing  \n",
    "• Distinguish OS vs. network rules |\n",
    "| **Q16 — Downloading Licensed Music** | A | B | I chose an option that is extremely likely (targeted ads). The question asked for the *least* likely outcome. | Ads = common, location-based reviews = rare. | • Analyze privacy consequences  \n",
    "• Identify likely vs. unlikely data usage  \n",
    "• Understand personalization algorithms |\n",
    "| **Q26 — Robot Movement** | C | A | I misread the robot logic. The correct program checks forward movement FIRST and rotates ONLY when blocked. | Robot logic: **check → move → rotate**. | • Trace robot movement  \n",
    "• Understand while/if logic  \n",
    "• Follow movement conditions precisely |\n",
    "| **Q31 — Loop Algorithms** | A | D | I didn’t simulate the robot’s moves completely. Neither program reaches the goal. | Always simulate step-by-step. | • Trace loops carefully  \n",
    "• Follow algorithm flow  \n",
    "• Visualize movement on grids |\n",
    "| **Q43 — Algorithm Runtime** | D | A | I confused approximation with runtime. The runtime grows quadratically (n²), which is still reasonable. | Polynomial = reasonable, exponential = unreasonable. | • Recognize runtime patterns  \n",
    "• Compare growth rates  \n",
    "• Understand algorithm efficiency |\n",
    "| **Q45 — NAND Logic Gate** | B | C | I forgot the correct Boolean meaning of NAND. NAND is the negation of AND. | NAND = **NOT (P AND Q)**. | • Know logic gate outputs  \n",
    "• Evaluate truth tables  \n",
    "• Apply Boolean expressions |\n",
    "| **Q46 — Undecidable Problems** | A | D | I incorrectly believed a low-level language could solve it. Undecidable means **no algorithm exists** for any language. | Undecidable = fundamentally unsolvable by algorithms. | • Understand decidability  \n",
    "• Recognize halting problem logic  \n",
    "• Know limits of computation |\n",
    "| **Q53 — Machine Learning Purpose** | D | A | I thought ML solves theoretical problems. It's actually about patterns, classification, and predictions using data. | ML = **patterns + predictions + data analysis**. | • Know ML applications  \n",
    "• Understand training data  \n",
    "• Identify patterns in datasets |\n",
    "| **Q59 — Movie Studio Media Librarian** | A | B | I didn’t consider the purpose of archiving. Lossy compression ruins quality permanently, making it the worst option. | Archiving must use **lossless only**. | • Know file compression types  \n",
    "• Understand data preservation  \n",
    "• Compare lossy vs. lossless formats |\n",
